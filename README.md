(Left) The digital twin is a virtual replica of the affected system, which
offers a safe environment for investigating the incident and testing response
actions. (Right) The network digital twin configuration adopted in our testbed.

## Artifacts

- The incident-response fine-tuning dataset used in our experiments is available on
  [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kimhammar/CSLE-IncidentResponse-V1/tree/main).

- The LoRA adapter weights of our fine-tuned model are available on
  [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/GYR1-determine/llmagent4incident-response).

## Attack Scenarios

The digital-twin experiments evaluate the incident-response framework under
three multi-stage attack scenarios of increasing scope and technique diversity.

| Scenario | Compromised servers | Main techniques |
|---|---:|---|
| **Weak-Credential-3** | 3 | SSH weak credentials, anonymous SMB access, and Shellshock exploitation |
| **Shellshock-4** | 4 | SSH password spraying, anonymous SMB access, Shellshock exploitation, and unauthorized HTTP upload |
| **Command-Injection-5** | 5 | SSH credential reuse, SMB staging, Shellshock exploitation, and diagnostic-service command injection |

The corresponding attack scripts and experiment inputs are:

- **Weak-Credential-3**: [`run_attack.py`](llm_ir_dt_new/run_attack.py),
  [`system.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/system.txt),
  [`logs.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/logs.txt), and
  [`incident.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/incident.txt).
- **Shellshock-4**: [`run_attack_four_servers_diverse.py`](llm_ir_dt_new/run_attack_four_servers_diverse.py),
  [`logs_four_servers_diverse.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/logs_four_servers_diverse.txt), and
  [`incident_four_servers_diverse.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/incident_four_servers_diverse.txt).
- **Command-Injection-5**: [`run_attack_five_servers_diverse.py`](llm_ir_dt_new/run_attack_five_servers_diverse.py),
  [`logs_5_servers_diverse.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/logs_5_servers_diverse.txt), and
  [`incident_5_servers_diverse.txt`](llm_ir_dt_new/inputs/incident_5_servers_diverse.txt).

## Experimental Environment

Offline fine-tuning was performed on a Google Cloud virtual machine with one
NVIDIA A100 GPU. The experiments use the
`DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B` base model with LoRA fine-tuning.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Cloud platform | Google Cloud |
| Machine type | `a2-highgpu-1g` |
| Provisioning model | Spot VM |
| Region | `us-central1` |
| GPU | 1 × NVIDIA A100 40 GB |
| Operating system | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| Boot disk | 200 GB balanced persistent disk |
| Base model | DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B |

Training the 14B model requires a CUDA-capable GPU with sufficient memory. The
fine-tuning commands below are not intended to run on a typical CPU-only host.




## Core Recovery Experiment

The main experiment is implemented by
[`run_recovery_loop_llm_state.py`](llm_ir_dt_new/run_recovery_loop_llm_state.py).
For one prioritized compromised server, the fine-tuned `checkpoint-850` model
generates candidate high-level recovery actions and predicts their local-state
transitions. DeepSeek V4 Pro translates each high-level action into executable
and verifiable commands, which are evaluated in the Docker digital twin.

Each local state contains six Boolean recovery criteria: containment,
knowledge sufficiency, forensic preservation, eradication, hardening, and
service recovery. At each planning step, the implementation generates three
candidate actions and evaluates each candidate with two rollouts. Candidate
selection first maximizes the fraction of valid rollouts that reach the
six-dimensional terminal state, then minimizes average command execution and
verification time, and finally maximizes average local-state progress as a
tie-breaker. Only the first action of the selected rollout is committed before
replanning.

The script recovers one prioritized server per invocation. To evaluate a full
scenario, run it once for each compromised server in that scenario and then
aggregate the per-server results. The commands below reproduce the core
experiment configuration with three candidate actions and two rollouts per
candidate.

> **Safety notice:** the included attack scripts and intentionally vulnerable
> containers must only be run inside the isolated Docker digital twin. Do not
> run them against external or production systems.

### 1. Prerequisites

The reference environment uses Ubuntu 22.04, Python 3.11, Docker Engine with
the Compose plugin, and an NVIDIA A100 40 GB GPU. A CUDA-capable GPU with enough
memory to load `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B` and the LoRA adapter is required.
The user running the experiment must be able to access the Docker daemon.

Check the main prerequisites:

```bash
python3.11 --version
docker --version
docker compose version
nvidia-smi
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaoLi-NYU/Agentic-Incident-Response-ESORICS26.git
cd Agentic-Incident-Response-ESORICS26
```

### 3. Configure the command-generation API

DeepSeek V4 Pro translates each selected high-level action into executable and
verification commands. Export the API key in the shell; never commit it to the
repository:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key"
test -n "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
```

### 4. Build and verify the digital twin

```bash
cd llm_ir_dt_new
python start.py
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
```

The expected deployment contains the gateway, client, SSH, Samba, Shellshock,
and web-server containers. `start.py` builds the images on the first run and
deploys the isolated client and server networks.

### 5. Run Weak-Credential-3

The following command recovers `server_ssh`. It restores the digital-twin
baseline, executes `run_attack.py`, generates and evaluates candidate recovery
actions, and stores the selected plans and timing results under `artifacts/`:

```bash
python -u run_recovery_loop_llm_state.py \
  --server server_ssh \
  --action-provider local-model \
  --adapter ../models/checkpoint-850 \
  --state-checkpoint ../models/checkpoint-850 \
  --num-candidates 3 \
  --num-rollouts 2 \
  --max-plan-steps 7 \
  --max-rollout-depth 7 \
  --action-max-new-tokens 500 \
  --action-temperature 0.6 \
  --action-top-p 0.9 \
  --state-max-new-tokens 1200 \
  --state-temperature 0.0 \
  --state-top-p 0.9 \
  --command-agent deepseek \
  --deepseek-model deepseek-v4-pro \
  --deepseek-api-key-env DEEPSEEK_API_KEY \
  --deepseek-base-url "https://api.deepseek.com" \
  --deepseek-max-tokens 8192 \
  --system-file inputs/system.txt \
  --logs-file inputs/logs.txt \
  --incident-file inputs/incident.txt \
  --dt-context-file inputs/dt_project_context_full.txt \
  --attack-script run_attack.py \
  --wait-seconds 15 \
  --artifacts-dir artifacts/recovery_loop_llm_state
```

A representative successful run selected six high-level actions. Replaying
the selected command plans in a freshly restored digital twin produced the
following verified result (times include command execution and verification):

```text
step=1 success=True time=11.270s action=Contain the attack by blocking 10.0.1.11 and quarantining 10.0.2.11.
step=2 success=True time=1.675s  action=Acquire disk, memory, gateway, SSH, and web evidence.
step=3 success=True time=0.699s  action=Analyze evidence and enumerate compromised credentials and indicators.
step=4 success=True time=1.030s  action=Reset compromised credentials, patch software, and rebuild from a trusted image.
step=5 success=True time=0.746s  action=Enforce key-based SSH, disable password authentication, and harden exposed services.
step=6 success=True time=0.296s  action=Restore validated data, return the server to production, and enable monitoring.
Replay complete. total_seconds=15.886
Final local state: containment=True, knowledge=True, preservation=True,
                   eradication=True, hardening=True, recovery=True
```


Repeat the command with `--server server_samba` and
`--server server_shellshock` to recover the other two compromised servers.

### 6. Run the larger scenarios

Keep all planning and model parameters unchanged. Replace only the scenario
inputs, attack script, and target server:

| Scenario | Logs | Incident | Attack script | Valid targets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weak-Credential-3 | `inputs/logs.txt` | `inputs/incident.txt` | `run_attack.py` | `server_ssh`, `server_samba`, `server_shellshock` |
| Shellshock-4 | `inputs/logs_four_servers_diverse.txt` | `inputs/incident_four_servers_diverse.txt` | `run_attack_four_servers_diverse.py` | previous three plus `server_web1` |
| Command-Injection-5 | `inputs/logs_5_servers_diverse.txt` | `inputs/incident_5_servers_diverse.txt` | `run_attack_five_servers_diverse.py` | previous four plus `server_web2` |

For example, run Shellshock-4 against `server_web1` by changing the four
arguments below in the core command:

```bash
--server server_web1 \
--logs-file inputs/logs_four_servers_diverse.txt \
--incident-file inputs/incident_four_servers_diverse.txt \
--attack-script run_attack_four_servers_diverse.py
```

### 7. Inspect the results

Each execution creates a timestamped directory under:

```text
llm_ir_dt_new/artifacts/recovery_loop_llm_state/runs/
```

The directory contains the experiment context, candidate evaluations, selected
command plans, state transitions, command outputs, verification results, and
measured execution times. A run is considered recovered only when all six
local-state fields reach `true` before the planning-step limit.

### 8. Stop the digital twin

```bash
python stop.py
```

prediction:
I note that in the logs there is no recorded activity or events; the logs are entirely blank, which means there is no evidence of suspicious or malicious behavior to analyze. Given that the system description outlines a peer-to-peer network with a decentralized mesh topology and multiple nodes each performing distinct roles such as bootstrap_node, relay_node, edge_node, validator_node, storage_node, and dht_node, I would expect to see logs indicating routine network traffic, peer discovery, data exchange, or consensus operations if there were any anomalies. The absence of any log entries suggests that the network is operating without issues or alerts. Additionally, the security monitoring system, which is a distributed Snort IDS covering all nodes with logs sent to 172.16.100.5, would normally capture and record any suspicious activities, such as intrusion attempts, known malicious IP connections, or protocol violations. Since no such entries appear in the logs, I infer that no security events or intrusions have been detected. The firewall rules include default allow_p2p_protocols and rate_limit_new_connections, which align with normal p2p network behavior, and the external_restrictions block known malicious IPs and limit new connections, further reducing the chance of successful attacks. Therefore, the combination of an empty log, a secure network design, and active security monitoring strongly supports the conclusion that the system is operating normally and that there is no incident or cyberattack occurring.</think>

}
label:
I note that in the logs provided, there is no information or recorded events indicating any abnormal activity, alerts, or warnings that might suggest a cyberattack or incident. Since the logs are completely blank, no suspicious connections, errors, or intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts such as those from Snort are present. I also observe from the system description that the IDS is deployed in a distributed manner covering all nodes, with centralized logging at 172.16.100.5. This comprehensive coverage makes it unlikely that any incidents would go undetected or unlogged if they occurred in the network. Additionally, the network is configured in a secured decentralized mesh topology with clear firewall rules including blocking known malicious IPs and rate-limiting new connections, which further reduces the attack surface and likelihood of successful intrusion. The system’s default policy allows peer-to-peer protocols, which explains normal traffic patterns without triggering alerts. Therefore, considering the absence of any logged suspicious activity, the robust IDS deployment, security firewall policies, and the controlled peer-to-peer environment, I conclude that the current blank logs and system state do not indicate a cyberattack incident but reflect normal operation.</think>
